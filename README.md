restaurant data analysis


Since there were 8368 data in each column in this data file, when classifying the data, we classified the data by the restaurant location and by each countryâ€™s cuisine using the population instead of sampled data.

Since the classification was made using the population, this analysis provides various advantages such as increased accuracy, reduced variability, secured representativeness, reduced need for estimation, increased accuracy of decision making, and better predictive models.

Key observations:

  - Midweek bookings for Indian cuisine are the highest at 30.209642, and weekend bookings are also high at 29.733382.

  - Weekday bookings for Japanese dishes are the lowest at 27.842262, and weekend bookings are also the lowest at 28.534970.

  - American, French, Italian, and Mexican dishes do not have much difference in weekday and weekend reservations.

  - Weekend reservations are evenly distributed between 28.5 and 30.0 for all dishes.

Comprehensive Analysis

  - Weekend reservations generally do not vary much by type of dish, but it is unusual that Indian dishes are noticeably high and Japanese dishes are low in weekday reservations.

  - Comparing the difference between weekday and weekend reservations, if weekday reservations are higher or lower than weekend reservations, it depends on the type of dish. Indian dishes have higher weekday reservations than weekend reservations, and Japanese dishes have     the opposite.

Observations and Analysis 2

![weekend_revenue_scatter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26dacc2b-0e78-408c-b06b-3b2389c0d41f)

Key observations:

  - For every additional weekend reservation, revenue increases by approximately $3,904.63. This indicates a positive and direct impact of weekend reservations on revenue. 

  - When there are zero weekend reservations, the predicted baseline revenue is approximately $540,916.18.

  - The scatter plot and linear regression analysis reveal a positive relationship between weekend reservations and revenue. While the model provides a useful trend for predicting revenue based on reservations, the variability in the data suggests the influence of other     factors.

Observations and Analysis 3

![marketing_followers_scatter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4b48bc9-5260-46d6-b118-c54252482611)

Key observations:

  - The data points (in blue) are tightly clustered around the regression line, indicating a strong linear relationship between the marketing budget and social media followers.

  - The positive slope of the line confirms that as the marketing budget increases, the number of social media followers also increases.

  - For every additional unit increase in the marketing budget, the number of social media followers increases by approximately 10.08. This suggests a direct and proportional impact of the marketing budget on gaining followers.

  - When the marketing budget is zero, the predicted number of social media followers is 3746.14. This represents the baseline number of followers without any marketing expenditure.

  - Scatter plot and linear regression analysis allow a clear and quantifiable understanding of the strong correlation between marketing budgets and social media followers.

Observations and Analysis 4

![avg_revenue_bar_comparison](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50af49aa-8a69-4081-bef0-8b4e042f1694)

Key observations:

  - When analyzing the relationship between the number of reservations and profits, Japanese cuisine has the highest revenue despite its relatively low number of reservations. This may suggest that Japanese cuisine has a high unit price.

  - On the other hand, Indian cuisine has a high number of reservations, but its revenue is relatively low. This suggests that the unit price is likely to be low.

  - French cuisine also has an average number of reservations, but it indicates that the unit price is high due to high profits.

  - Mexican cuisine is on the lower end, both in terms of reservation and revenue.
